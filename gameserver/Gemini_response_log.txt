Request: Generate a description for a new room in my adventure game. Pre-existing room descriptions for inspiration:
An old, stone structure stands in solitude amid the vast emptiness. Its weather-worn façade whispers secrets of forgotten tales. Icy gusts howl through the post's dark crevices. Eastwards, the Forgotten Pathway beckons.
,
At the end of the Forgotten Pathway, an imposing stone gatehouse towers overhead. Vines march across its forgotten surface, and a heavy iron gate creaks in the steady wind, guarding the entrance to an unseen realm.
,
The corridor continues towards more bedrooms. Soft carpet cushions each step, with doors leading off to various chambers of sanctuary and rest.
,
A circular room filled with antique celestial maps and artifact-laden bookshelves. A nearby spyglass peers into the inky void, revealing shimmering constellations.
,
Adorned with constellations of glowing flora, this shimmering sanctuary booms with stellar symphonies, echoing with cosmic whisperings and bathed in an otherworldly glow.
,
Bathed in ethereal light, this auditorium radiates an aura of the cosmos. Its circular stage is lined with celestial stones, each pulsating with mysterious cosmic energy.
,
A bewildering array of reflective surfaces amplify the glow of distant stars, creating a shifting, starlit labyrinth that distorts space and time.
,
An ancient and mystical stone observatory, bathed in the mesmerizing cosmic glow, where time feels irrelevant against the eternal cosmic dance.
,
This cozy corner offers a tranquil respite, with shelves of astral artifacts, a telescope peering into the abyss of space, and plush bean bags for lounging stargazers.
,
The corridor takes you from the hall to bedrooms and living rooms. Soft carpet cushions each step, with doors leading off to various chambers of sanctuary and rest.
This room is called 'Silent Gorge'

Respond with only a description of similar length to the ones above, nothing else.

Response: Silent Gorge

Lying within a vast chasm, Silent Gorge is a haunting and desolate place. Its towering stone walls are etched with ancient glyphs, and the air hangs heavy with an oppressive silence. The only sound comes from the eerie echo of forgotten whispers carried on the icy wind.
