There is a Treasure Chest here: An ancient, wooden treasure chest, adorned with intricate carvings and bound by a heavy iron lock.
The player issues this command: 
Respond with a JSON object as follows:
If this makes sense (try to be creative flexible and permissive, allowing some artistic license), respond with feedback to the player in string property 'success_response' and any combination (or none) of the following:
* Something the player says in string property 'player_utterance'.
* The updated description of the current location in string property 'updated_location'.
* The updated descriptions of any modified items (only those listed earlier) as nested object property 'updated_items', with item names as keys and new descriptions as values.
* The descriptions of any newly created items as nested object property 'new_items', with new item names as keys and descriptions as values.
* The descriptions of any destroyed/deleted items as string array 'deleted_items'. (If an item has changed so much that its name no longer applies, then delete it and replace it with one or more new items. Note that an item cannot be both updated and deleted.)
* The updated descriptions of any modified entities (only those listed earlier) as nested object property 'updated_entities', with entity names as keys and new descriptions as values.
Only include the updated elements if they have changed in a way that another player who did not witness the cause of the change would notice.
 If the command doesn't make sense or is too unrealistic, provide a meaningful response in JSON with element 'rejection_response'.
